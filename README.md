# üèçÔ∏è Two-Wheeler Rider Intention Prediction

This project uses **Machine Learning** to predict the **riding intention of a two-wheeler driver** (e.g., left turn, right lane change, straight, stop, etc.) based on extracted **VGG16 deep learning features** from rider movement data.

The web interface is built with **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload `.npy` feature files and receive real-time predictions of rider intentions.

## üöÄ Features
- Upload `.npy` files containing extracted VGG16 features  
- Automatic preprocessing and feature pooling  
- Machine Learning‚Äìbased classification of riding intentions  
- Interactive and lightweight Streamlit web interface  
- Easily deployable on **Streamlit Cloud**

## üß† Model Information
The prediction model was trained using **scikit-learn** and **XGBoost**, with optional feature scaling applied via **StandardScaler**.  
Classes predicted by the model include:

| Numeric Label | Predicted Intention      |
|----------------|--------------------------|
| 0              | Left Lane Change         |
| 1              | Left Turn                |
| 2              | Right Lane Change        |
| 3              | Right Turn               |
| 4              | Slow-Stop                |
| 5              | Straight                 |
